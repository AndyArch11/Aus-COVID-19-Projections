N.B. Queensland Health predicts one in four Australians will eventually contract the virus
Infection doubling rates are regarded as 6-8 days, but Australia is currently seeing doubling every 3 -4 days of diagnosed people. However, this could be due to increased testing.
Total mortality as stated by WHO is 2 - 3%, but the Lancet believes it to be more like 5-7%

https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics
N.B Australia has 3 - 4 times the incidence of cancer as the US, so either AU does actually have more cancer such as skin cancer, or the US does not diagnose rates of cancer as effectively, presumably due to their health system and cost barriers?

Chronic Respiratory Disease

https://www.cdc.gov/copd/data.html
N.B. US does not appear to have a good handle on prevalance rates, most stats are on morbidity rates and classification might also be different to AU, which could explain difference in percentage rates between the two countries.
