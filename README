Excel naive projection of COVID-19 in Australia. Have since added Excel spreadsheets for other countries as well.

In reality, growth should slow with isolation and quarantine measures and as people get over the infection they in turn will create a herd immunity, and so the infection can burn itself out.  

However, it is not known to what extent that the infection rate can be slowed, over what period, and no guarantee that it will burn itself out.

These are worst case projections that remain valid up until the point that control measures begin to slow infection rates in a population.
