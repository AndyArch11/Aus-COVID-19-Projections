Excel naive projection of COVID-19 in Australia from 15/3/2020 now that the infections are communal and exponential.

In reality, growth should slow with isolation and quarantine measures and as people get over the infection, they in turn will create a herd immunity, and so the infection can burn itself out.  

However, it is not known to what extent that the infection rate can be slowed, over what period, and no guarantee that it will burn itself out.

Mid April should be the inflection point if the current infection rate continues unabated, when hospital systems are overwhelmed, possibly sooner as Australia has no current surge capacity.  

Mid May should see majority of population infected given current infection rates.  Peak infection should be mid to late May, with most people recoving by 2 weeks from infection.  As hospitalisation recovery can be up to 6+ weeks, hospitals are likely to not see numbers dropping until July.
